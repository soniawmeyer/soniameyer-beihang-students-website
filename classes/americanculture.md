###Week 8: April 27 & April 30
Simplified Instructions:

	Option A: Cultural Norms
	Definition: behavior patterns that are typical of specific groups
	Chinese translation: 文化规范／行为规范
	1) Choose 1 specific Chinese cultural norm
		2) Email me (sonia@meyercraft.net) for approval
	3) Research if this norm exists in America (If similar, how so? If different, what is the difference? Why is it different?)
	4) Create a presentaiton
	5) Practice your presentation
	6) Write a summary paragraph
	7) Print the summary paragraph
	8) Bring the summary paragraph and your presentation to class
	
	Example:
	Norm: Chinese people always drink hot water.
	Group Presentation Sections:
	-Person 1: Chinese people always drink hot water. This is clearly shown by the fact that the Chinese national drink is tea, and by the hot water fountains in the school's hallways.
	-Person 2: Chinese people believe there are a lot of health benefits from drinking tea. Boiling water also kills the germs in the water, so it is safer to drink.
	-Person 3: According to our research, Americans do not like to drink hot water very much. Although they often like to drink coffee, and sometimes even tea, most people prefer cold water and the schools have cold water fountains in the hallways.
	-Person 4: Americans also prefer to have ice in their drinks, including water, tea, and soda. In the US, tap water is drinkable, which means that it does not need to be boiled for safety. 
	-Person 5: In conclusion, Americans do not share the Chinese cultural norm of drinking hot water.

	Option B: American Media
	1) Choose 1 behavior/value from an American movie/TV show
	2) Email me (sonia@meyercraft.net) for approval
	3) Research if this behavior/value is accurate (If similar, how so? If different, what is the difference? Why is it different?)
	4) Create a presentaiton
	5) Practice your presentation
	6) Write a summary paragraph
	7) Print the summary paragraph
	8) Bring the summary paragraph and your presentation to class
	
	Example:
	Behavior from TV show: The Vampire Diaries -- How do these high school student have so much free time and seem like they never go to school?
	Group Presentation Sections:
	-Person 1: The teenagers in the Vampire Diaries seem to have complete freedom to do whatever they want. Their parents never seem to intervene, and the school doesn't seem to mind that they miss so much school.
	-Person 2: Show a short clip of the behavior. You can see in this clip, that the high school students are hanging out at a bar. 
	-Person 3: In China, this behavior could never happen because students are too busy preparing for the gaokao. While American students also have to prepare for the SAT test, it is not as strenuous as the gaokao. 
	-Person 4: According to our research, this kind of behavior does not accurately reflect American families. Most American parents have more influence over their children, and it is illegal for people under 21 to go into a bar.  
	-Person 5: In conclusion, The Vampire Diaries does not accurately represent high school life.
