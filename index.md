# Welcome Students!

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

##Closing announcements:

Thank you all for a wonderful semester! I am so sad to be leaving China, and I will miss you all dearly. Best of luck in your studies, and should any of you make your way to DC, contact me via WeChat!
	
Your grades are finished. Now you can check for the most updated version of your grades. Please email me if you believe there are any mistakes. If you believe there is a mistake, please also include evidence of why you believe it is a mistake. Evidence can include photos of the grades I gave to you, or explanations for why you think there is an error.
		
Update: June 30, 2015 -- Grades have been submitted, I can no longer make changes to them.

##[Grades](gradesform/form/form.html)
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
