#What is plagiarism?

###Plagiarism is taking another person's words as your own.

This can be copying and pasting from a Wikipedia article on the internet.

This can be copying and pasting from a textbook or research article.

How do you use someone else's words without stealing them? You give them credit by using quotes and citations.

If you are using the exact same words another person used, you must use "quotes".

If you are using your own words to summarize their idea, you must reference them in the text or with a citation.

###Examples

Example of a quote: Mrs. Meyer said, "Plagiarism is unacceptable."

Example of referencing an idea: According to Einstein, the theory of relativity can be categorized into two theories.

Example of a citation: The theory of relativity includes special relativity and general relativity (Einstein).
