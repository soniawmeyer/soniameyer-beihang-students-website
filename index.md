	Title: “Global Philanthropy Among Chinese and Chinese Americans”
	Presenter: Victor Kuo, Founder, VK Global Advising
	Date: Thursday, June 11
	Time: 6:00-7:30 pm
	Location: Columbia Global Centers in 中关村
	Cost: Free
Description: 
China’s dramatic economic growth is drawing attention to charitable giving. In late 2014, the International Monetary Fund declared China the world’s largest economy, surpassing the United States. Simultaneously, a new class of wealthy Chinese have arisen. By some estimates, China has 430 billionaires compared to 537 in the U.S. And the rate of growth of millionaires in China is equivalent to the rate of the U.S. In 2010, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett visited with wealthy Chinese to encourage philanthropy, and Jack Ma, China’s biggest philanthropist last year, declared the establishment of one of China’s biggest philanthropic trusts. Despite the growth and activity, philanthropy in China is still nascent. This public talk will explore trends among philanthropists in China as well as among Chinese American philanthropists in the United States. Speakers will provide context and emerging trends and present the framework of the “Global Chinese Philanthropy Initiative” – an ongoing research project to explore the  motivations and impacts of Chinese and Chinese American philanthropists. Audience members will engage with presenters in conversation about the cultural, social, economic, and political context of China and the U.S. and their impacts on effective giving. The discussion will also consider trends in transnational giving and perceptions of philanthropists of Chinese descent in China, the U.S., and worlwide. Event participants are encouraged to offer their perspectives and engage in lively conversation.
