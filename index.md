# Welcome Students!

As you may have read already, I am still in America even though the semester has already started. There are two reasons. The first reason is that my husband's cousin is getting married! The second is that I am getting corrective eye surgery and need some time for recovery. That being said, I have already posted information in your class website (see below) with some information including the class syllabus, a quiz, and an information collection form, all of which are due **March 20th**. Please proceed to your class's website by clicking the link below.

Update: I am getting ready for my flight tomorrow morning and I am very excited to be returning to China. I have recovered very quickly from my eye surgery, and the family wedding was wonderful. It is OK to complete the assignments late, but please complete them before your first class, and bring your certificate with you with your name on the certificate. 

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
