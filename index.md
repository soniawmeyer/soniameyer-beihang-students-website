# Welcome Students!

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

##[Grades](gradesform/form/form.html)
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of email at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.

#Announcement: Students, please stop emailing me about your participation grade.

As it clearly states in the syllabus: "Class Participation: This is a major percentage of your grade meaning it is very important! Attendance is required and especially important for language learning. I expect students to participate by speaking in class, asking questions, and talking during group discussions." 

If you did the bare minimum, attending every class, you will get a 15 out of 25. Since attendance is required by the school, it cannot be an important factor in your grade. Participation is more than just sitting in class. I told you at the beginning of the semester to get full credit you need to be active in class. 80% of you were not, and therefore you got 15 out of 25.
