# Welcome Students!

As you may have read already, I am still in America even though the semester has already started. There are two reasons. The first reason is that my husband's cousin is getting married! The second is that I am getting corrective eye surgery and need some time for recovery. That being said, I have already posted information in your class website (see below) with some information including the class syllabus, a quiz, and an information collection form, all of which are due **March 20th**. Please proceed to your class's website by clicking the link below.

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.

#Announcement: Your grades have been sent in. Although I'll be traveling, please do email me if there is a discrepancy between your grade here and the record of your grade that your Chinese teacher has.
