# Welcome Students!

A few announcements:

		!!!Attention Monday students: I made a mistake, your finals start next week. Make sure you take a look at your timeslot and the instructions. 
		
		All students: You do not need to email me asking for excused absences.
		
		All students: For the semester project, you need to take a picture of yourself at the lecture.
	


	

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

## Classes

Graduate Students: [American Culture](/classes/americanculture.html)

English Majors/Minors: [Oral Communication](/classes/oralenglish.html)

##[Grades](gradesform/form/form.html)
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
