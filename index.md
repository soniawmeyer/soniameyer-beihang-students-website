# Welcome Students!

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

## Classes

Graduate Student: [American Culture](/classes/americanculture)

English Minors: [Oral English](/classes/oralenglish)

##[Grades]()
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of email at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
