## Classes

Graduate Students: [American Culture](/classes/americanculture.html)

English Majors/Minors: [Oral Communication](/classes/oralenglish.html)

##[Grades](gradesform/form/form.html)
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
