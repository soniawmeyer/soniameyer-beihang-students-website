# Welcome Students!

A few announcements about your grades:

	Your grades are finished. Now you can check for the most updated version of your grades. Please email me if you believe there are any mistakes. If you believe there is a mistake, please also include evidence of why you believe it is a mistake. Evidence can include photos of the grades I gave to you, or explanations for why you think there is an error.
	
	I did give extra credit for things like attending the English Corners, exceptional semester projects, and exceptional midterm presentations. As a result, your final score may be more than the cumulative score, however, if your final score is lower than the cumulative score, let me know! And if there are problems with your student number, also let me know.
	
	DO NOT email me claiming that you did not plagiarize. It is very easy for me to identify plagiarism. Do not try to lie to me or decieve me, I can tell.
	

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.
