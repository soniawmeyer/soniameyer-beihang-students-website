	Speaker: Kaiser Kuo, Host of the Sinica Podcast

	When: Wednesday, June 17, 2pm-4pm
	Where: Wenjin International Hotel
	Event Name: “Managing China’s Petcoke Problem”
	Speaker: Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy
Description: Petroleum coke (petcoke), a by-product of petroleum refining that is high in contaminants, has quietly emerged in China as an inexpensive but environmentally harmful alternative to coal. Although the Chinese government is committed to reducing coal consumption for environmental reasons, knowledge about the negative environmental impact of petcoke is not yet widespread. If the country’s efforts to reduce air pollution are to be effective, petcoke’s contribution to carbon emissions must be addressed.
 
Carnegie–Tsinghua’s Wang Tao will present his findings on how China can mitigate the effects of petcoke pollution. Then Richard Xie will moderate a discussion with Mao Xianqiang and Conway Irwin exploring the implications of, and policy responses to, China’s growing use of petcoke and the country’s ongoing commitment to reducing carbon emissions.
 
Wang Tao is an expert on climate and energy issues and runs a program at the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy that examines China’s climate and energy policies, with particular attention to transportation and international climate negotiations.
 
Richard Xie is the associate director of external affairs for the Paulson Institute’s China office. He previously worked for the Economist Group and for Dow Jones International.
 
Mao Xianqiang is a professor of environmental studies at Beijing Normal University. His research centers on how China manages its environmental policy and related economic policies.
 
Conway Irwin is as an environmental affairs specialist at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. She previously worked as an energy markets analyst for the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

	When: Friday, June 19, 3pm-4:30pm
	Where: Stanford Center at Peking University (SCPKU)
	Event Name: “Heidegger in China: Possibilities for an East-West Dialogue”
	Speaker: Thomas Sheehan, Professor of Religious Studies, Stanford University

Description: Over the last years, a paradigm shift in Heidegger research has been gaining momentum in the United States. The paradigm shift is motivated by and strictly based on the entirety of Heidegger's works, and especially the posthumous publications from 1989 to the present. It moves beyond the "classical paradigm" established by such scholars as William J. Richardson, Otto Pöggeler, and Friedrich-Wilhelm von Herrmann. This lecture lays out the main features of the paradigm shift and raises questions for discussion about how this reformulation of Heidegger's project might enter into dialogue with contemporary Chinese scholarship on Heidegger.

	When: Friday, June 19, 7pm-9pm
	Where: University of Chicago Center Beijing
	Event Name: “Ronald Burt on Network Gossip: The Social Origins of Reputation”
	Speaker: Ronald Burt, Professor, University of Chicago Booth School of Business

Description: Competitive advantage in networks is created by information breadth, timing, and arbitrage advantages from bridging structural holes. Benefiting from the advantage, however, depends on having sufficient social standing to be accepted as a network broker (formal authority, informal authority, and especially reputation which most allows new talent to rise up).  The processes by which social standing is allocated provide governance in social networks, making the origins of reputation critical to understanding competitive advantage.  In nonhuman networks, reputation emerges in a well-known way within closed networks distributing trusted information from repeated observation (eBay, Amazon, etc.; bandwidth effect).  In human networks, however, closed networks typically play a more active role in defining reputations.  Closed networks operate as echo chambers in which people share selected stories in casual gossip intended to strengthen connections with one another (echo effect).  Sharing the same opinion again and again makes people feel connected but they become ignorantly certain in their opinions of others — reputations become amplified to persistent positive and negative extremes.  In short, reputations are a by-product of people building relations with one another, which has implications for network governance and managing reputation.
