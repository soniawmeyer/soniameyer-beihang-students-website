# Welcome Students!

I will post all the class material to this website, so be sure to check it frequently. If you have questions, [email me](mailto:sonia@meyercraft.net).

## Classes

Graduate Student: [American Culture](/classes/americanculture.html)

English Minors: [Oral English](/classes/oralenglish.html)

##[Grades](gradesform/form/form.html)
You can check your grade at any point during the semester. This means I will not respond to a flood of emails at the end of the semester nor change any grades. Stay on top of your own grades; if there are mistakes, I will be happy to fix it before the end of the semester.

#Announcement: DO NOT EMAIL ME about your participation grade.

I will not change anyone's participation grade under any circumstances. Stop emailing me about it. 

There is still time before the end of the semester to complete the extra credit.

#Announcement: No class next Wednesday
Previously I had planned to have one last "fun" class on Jan 7, but it seems that most of you would rather study for your finals, so we will not have class on Jan 7. If you are one of the few who prefer to have class, please email me and I will arrange something.

#New Announcement: Friday is the last day for extra credit
Friday, January 9, 5 pm, is the last day to email me extra credit.
